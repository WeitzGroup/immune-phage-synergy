# immune-phage-synergy
MATLAB scripts for simulating a model of phage therapy with bacteria, phage and immune cell populations.

The scripts generate figures in the preprint: Chung Yin (Joey) Leung and Joshua S. Weitz, Synergistic elimination of
bacteria by phage and the immune system, bioRxiv doi: 10.1101/057927. (https://doi.org/10.1101/057927)

Each folder contains a main script in the format "fig*_***.m" which generates the corresponding figure.
