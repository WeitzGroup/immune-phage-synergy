# immune-phage-synergy
MATLAB scripts for simulating a model of phage therapy with bacteria, phage and immune cell populations.

The scripts generate figures in the paper: Chung Yin (Joey) Leung and Joshua S. Weitz, Modeling the synergistic elimination of bacteria by phage and the innate immune system, Journal of Theoretical Biology 429, 241 (2017). [DOI: 10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.06.037](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2017.06.037)

Preprint available at bioRxiv [doi: 10.1101/057927](https://doi.org/10.1101/057927).

Each folder contains a main script in the format "fig*_***.m" which generates the corresponding figure.
